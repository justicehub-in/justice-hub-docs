### Importance of data citation

    - Support proper attribution and credit
    - Support collaboration and reuse of data
    - Enable reproducibility of findings
    - Foster faster and more efficient research progress, and
    - Provide the means to share data with future researchers

Also, 

Citing data is important, because it:

- Ensures you give credit to the individual or group who generated the data
- Helps the reader identify and find the data
- Promotes data reproducibility, enabling others to replicate and verify research results
- Facilitates collaboration for researchers to reuse and build on research findings
- Helps track the impact and reuse of data sets
- Increases the discoverability of your research by enabling anyone reading the article to locate the dataset

### Information required from data contributors to enable data citation

 - Author - The creator of the dataset
 - Publication date
 - Title
 - Publisher - The organisation either hosting the data[21] or performing quality assurance
 - Location - A persistent URL from which the dataset is available. (__This is the URL of the dataset on the Justice Hub)

The most important elements – the ones that should be present in any citation – are the `author`, the `title` and `date`, the `location`, and the `publisher`. These give due credit, allow the reader to judge the relevance of the dataset, permit access to it, and give reassurances about its quality or persistence, respectively. In theory, they should between them uniquely identify the dataset.
