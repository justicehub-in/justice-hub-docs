I'm an [RStudio certified trainer][rstudio-trainer] and a data scientist at [Moffitt Cancer Center][moffitt] where I work in the [Collaborative Data Services Core][moffitt-cdsc] using R, Shiny, and the tools of data science to accelerate research towards the prevention and cure of cancer.
Previously, I was a Ph.D. candidate at the [University of South Florida][usf] in Tampa, FL in the Department of [Industrial and Management Sciences Engineering][usf-imse] where I helped develop a [smart home to enable healthy aging in-place](http://news.usf.edu/article/templates/?a=7974&z=220).

I'm a passionate R user and educator.
I build [web apps][garrick-apps] using [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/), [tools and packages][garrick-projects] for [R](http://r-project.org), and dynamic, interactive, reproducible reports using [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com).
