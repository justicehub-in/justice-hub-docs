The idea of a data/community hub is not new, and a few members of the Justice Hub team are part of one or the other open data hubs as either users, contributors or volunteers. We started exploring how this idea would fit in the law and justice space, a few data driven or empirical research projects that we were a part of mostly contributed to this idea of curating a repository of well documented datasets in this datasets. 

There are a few common challenges which people face when we start working on a new idea, project or a proposal. Finding data is hard, working with external data is harder and building trust around the datasets, especially when the data collection methodologies are not available, is the hardest. One way of solving some of these challenges, at-least, is through well maintained open data ecosystems that are often backed by a strong community of users, contributors and maintainers. 

We started working on the idea of the [Justice Hub](https://justicehub.in/) in December 2019. It started as a short experiment where we wanted to explore a few ideas that we submitted a grant proposal in the [Agami - Data4Justice challenge](https://www.agami.in/data-challenge-2019). In these six months, all we wanted to do was to learn, from the creators of data, from the users of legal data and from the existing data ecosystems that are operational throughout the world in different sectors. Our idea was to get closer to this community and learn not only about the challenges it faces, but also about it's strengths. We believe that any project or initiative that wants to work for and with the community, needs to constantly learn about the strong points and build around them and not just the problems it faces.

This talk by [Cormac Russell](https://www.nurturedevelopment.org/who-we-are/cormac-russell/), on _Sustainable community development_ better articulates this idea.

An in-person discussion with our partners or a group meeting to brain storm a few ideas for the Hub, is the most productive way to collaborate. But given the diversity, both geographical and in terms of work, sometimes it gets difficult to keep everyone involved about the activities around the Justice Hub. This is why, it is important as a group to write about these ideas, share them in a language people understand and relate to. Only then we'll walk on the path of inclusivity and collaboration. We, ourselves learn a lot from similar initiatives from around the globe. If they had not shared their journey, we could have not landed here at this time. Writing is our way of giving back, sharing what we have learnt and asking for help where needed. 

In this post, we want to focus on the _Why_ of writing and we have another post that talks about the _how we write - the process_. Please check it out as well, if you'd want to write for the Justice Hub.
