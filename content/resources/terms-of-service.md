* The purpose of the Justice Hub (A collaborative legal data platform) is to enable the sharing of data across the legal and justice sector. We collaborate with our partners, including researchers, practitioners, and government agencies to curate and understand data relevant to the operations of the justice ecosystem.
* Only approved organisations are able to share data through the platform.
* JusticeHub will work with its partners to assess the quality of the datasets before the data can be shared on the platform. Any dataset that does not fit the data quality framework of the JusticeHub will not be uploaded on the JusticeHub
* The data moderators at JusticeHub will work with the data contributors to identify gaps in the datasets and document the processes required before the data can be shared on the platform
* JusticeHub does not allow data that includes personally identifiable information (PII) to be shared publicly through the site. All data shared publicly must be sufficiently aggregated or anonymized so as to prevent identification of people or other harm to affected people and the  community. 
* JusticeHub endeavors not to allow publicly shared data that includes community identifiable information (CII) or demographically identifiable information (DII) that may put affected people at risk. However, this type data is more challenging to identify within datasets during our quality assurance process without deeper analysis. We invite users of the JusticeHub to notify us should they become aware of this type of data being shared through the site.
* Organisations sharing data through the platform should ensure, to the extent possible, that all data was collected in a legal, ethical and responsible manner
* Datasets on the platform  can be shared under a user-selected Creative Commons license or as public domain. 
* Should a user become aware of data shared through the JusticeHub platform that could cause harm by being shared openly, the user should contact judiciary@civicdatalab.in immediately to request that the data be removed.
* Data shared through the JusticeHub platform will be held indefinitely or until such a time that the data contributor deletes it, or there is a request from a user for it to be deleted. In the latter case, the user would have to provide a convincing reason (e.g. privacy) and possibly also supporting evidence for the claim.
* If a data source becomes aware of data that has been shared through the JusticeHub platform by a third party and disagrees with it being shared, the data source should contact judiciary@civicdatalab.in to request that the data be removed.
* If CivicDataLab as system administrator of the JusticeHub platform becomes aware of any data that is in violation of these Terms of Service, CivicDataLab will contact the individual or organization to notify them.
