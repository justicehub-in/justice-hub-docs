Our objective is to curate and host well-documented datasets on the platform. To move ahead on that route, we will use this space to share resources and guidebooks that might help you in contributing good quality datasets. We will also use this space to highlight certain information resources curated from the community of legal data enthusiasts so that we can learn and further evolve in our journeys to open and maintain data repositories over a longer term which can help fill a few large data-gaps in the law and justice sector. To stay updated with the latest datasets, community events, and workshops join us on Substack.

["dataset.html", "Chapter 1 The Dataset", " Chapter 1 The Dataset What is a legal dataset? Note: Content under this section is reproduced from a research paper titled - A Realistic Guide to Making Data Available Alongside Code to Improve Reproducibility by Nicholas J Tierney &amp; Karthik Ram. To share data analysis data, there should be some minimal set of requirements. For example, the data should contain information on metadata, data dictionaries, the README, and data used in analysis. There are 8 pieces of content to consider for data sharing: README: A Human readable description of the data Data dictionary: Human readable dictionary of data contents License: How to use and share the data Citation: How you want your data to be cited Machine readable meta data: Make your data searchable Raw data: The original/first data provided Scripts: To clean raw data ready for analysis Analysis ready data: Final data used in analysis To arrange the files, a tried and tested layout is shared below for your reference: Next, we’ll discuss a few sections, mentioned above, in detail and also share a few reference links from other data repositories.

["readme.html", "1.1 README", " 1.1 README A README is often the first place people will go to learn more about anything in a folder - they are very common in software, and historically were included so the uppercase letters of README meant it would be at the top of a directory. The README is meant for someone to read and understand more about the data and contains the who, what, when, where, why, &amp; how: Who collected it What is the data When was it collected Where was it collected Why it was collected How is was collected With one README per dataset, It should be brief, and provide links to the other aforementioned sections. It should also contain any other guidance for the user on how to read and interpret the whole dataset. References Vera Institute of Justice - Incarceration Trends Dataset "],
["data-dictionary.html", "1.2 Data Dictionary", " 1.2 Data Dictionary A data dictionary provide human readable description of the data, providing context on the nature and structure of the data. This helps someone not familiar with the data understand, and use the data. At a minimum they should contain the following pieces of information about the data: variable names variable labels variable codes, and special values for missing data. Data Dictionary An example data dictionary table from incarceration trends repository. This includes information on the variable, its class (type), and a longer description. Variable Class Description year integer (date) Year urbanicity character County-type (urban, suburban, small/mid, rural) pop_category character Category for population - either race, gender, or Total rate_per_100000 double Rate within a category for prison population per 100,000 people Note: Every data dictionary should also be provided in its raw form (e.g., a CSV) in the repository References The code book How to code variables Data Dictionary: a how to and best practices Create a data dictionary How to Make a Data Dictionary "],

["dataset-search.html", "4.1 Searching for datasets on the hub", " 4.1 Searching for datasets on the hub Link to the official CKAN documentation to search for datasets on CKAN platforms Justice Hub (JH) supports two search modes, both are used from the same search field. If the search terms entered into the search field contain no colon (“:”) JH will perform a simple search. If the search expression does contain at least one colon (“:”) JH will perform an advanced search. 4.1.1 Simple Search The search words typed by the user in the search box defines the main “query” constituting the essence of the search. The + and - characters are treated as mandatory and prohibited modifiers for terms. Text wrapped in balanced quote characters (for example, “Assam Correctional Homes”) is treated as a phrase. By default, all words or phrases specified by the user are treated as optional unless they are preceded by a + or a -. CKAN will search for the complete word and when doing simple search wildcards are not supported. Simple search examples census will search for all the datasets containing the word “census” in the query fields. census +2019 will search for all the datasets contaning the word “census” and filter only those matching also “2019” as it is treated as mandatory. census -2019 will search for all the datasets containing the word “census” and will exclude “2019” from the results as it is treated as prohibited. european census will search for all the datasets containing the phrase “european census”. Searching for testing or tested will show also results containing the word “test”. If the Name of the dataset contains words separated by - it will consider each word independently in the search. 4.1.2 Advanced Search If the query has a colon in it it will be considered a fielded search. This will allow us to use wildcards *, proximity matching ~ and general features described in Solr docs. The basic syntax is field:term. Advanced Search Examples title:european this will look for all the datasets containing in its title the word “european”. title:europ* this will look for all the datasets containing in its title a word that starts with “europ” like “europe” and “european”. title:europe || title:africa will look for datasets containing “europe” or “africa” in its title. title: \"european census\" ~ 4 A proximity search looks for terms that are within a specific distance from one another. This example will look for datasets which title contains the words “european” and “census” within a distance of 4 words. author:powell~ CKAN supports fuzzy searches based on the Levenshtein Distance, or Edit Distance algorithm. To do a fuzzy search use the “~” symbol at the end of a single-word term. In this example words like “jowell” or “pomell” will also be found. Field names used in advanced search may differ from Datasets Attributes, the mapping rules are defined in the schema file. You can use title to search by the dataset name and text to look in a catch-all field that includes author, license, mantainer, tags, etc. We’re working to add more contextual examples to our documentation. Meanwhile. if you face any issues or have any doubts, please write to info@justicehub.in and we’ll be happy to assist you in exploring and finding datasets on the Justice Hub. "],
